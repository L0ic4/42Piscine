👉 This repository contains the code and solutions I developed during my 42 Piscine experience.

Piscine is a 26-day intensive immersion program that introduces students to the 42 curriculum and methodology. It covers a wide range of programming concepts, from the basics of C programming to more advanced topics like algorithms and data structures.

I encourage you to read and understand the code before attempting to copy it. Blind copying will not help you learn the material and will ultimately hinder your progress as a developer.

Please feel free to use this repository as a learning resource, but do not copy my code without understanding it.
